A churchmouse named William tells the story from a mouses viewpoint. He begins with the decision by the pilgrims preacher to move to America, and the packing of the Mayflower. A disaster at sea threatens to sink the ship, but William the pilgrim mouse has an idea to save the ship. The pilgrims land safely and write the Mayflower Compact. They begin to build their new colony and church, but it is already Fall and they do not have enough food stored. The winter is so harsh and food so limited that many pilgrims do not live through the winter. The pilgrims learn to plant crops in the Spring, and in the Fall celebrate with a big feast, the first Thanksgiving. William also scuttles a plan to blame the Indians for an attack on the pilgrims.Romeo Muller who wrote/adapted the Rudolph special and others wrote this story. Maury Laws who did such a good job with the music on the other specials wrote the music for this one, while Jules Bass wrote the lyrics. The songs include \"Elbow Room\" about the tight conditions on ship, A  song by Priscilla called \"When He Looks at Me\", a love song between John and Priscilla called \"Time Stands Still\" which is reprised with the arrival of Spring. The Pilgrims sing  \"This Land was Meant to be Free\", while they are full of hope and building a new church and village.  Kids love this film, and it has a wonderful ending.This 1 hour TV special originally aired on NBC on November 23, 1968.  It is done in traditional cel animation. The tale is narrated and sung by Tennessee Ernie Ford, Captain Standish is voiced by Eddie Albert, Priscilla is voiced by Joanie Summers (yes, of Happy Days). Four different characters are are performed by the famous voice artist Paul Frees, including Captain Jones, Smiling Buzzard, Quizzler, and Scurv.This was produced by Rankin/Bass Studios, who were in high demand due to the success of their 1964 stop motion hit, \"Rudolph, the Red Nosed Reindeer\". After Rudolph their next holiday special was \"Cricket on the Hearth\" in 1967, a traditional cel animated feature, then the Mouse on the Mayflower the following year. In addition to Rudolph the studio made over 35 TV specials, of which about 19 are holiday specials. Some of the others include Year without a Santa Claus, Nestor the Long Eared Donkey, The Little Drummer Boy, Frosty the Snowman, Santa Claus is Coming\\'to Town, Here Comes Peter Cottontail, Cricket on the Hearth, the Stingiest Man in Town, \\'Twas the Night Before Christmas, A Christmas Tree, Pinnochio\\'s Christmas, Rudolph\\'s Shiny New Year, the First Easter Bunny, The Easter Bunny is Coming\\'to Town, Leprechauns Christmas, The First Christmas, and Frosty\\'s Winter Wonderland. They also made non-holiday films such as the Hobbit; Flight of Dragons; Mad Monster Party, & the Last Unicorn. It is incredible that one company is responsible for all those TV specials, which are 95% of the ones broadcast every year. Their studio\\'s work includes standard animation, stop-motion animagic, and live action. They really are a huge part of our pop culture history. I hope this comes out on a restored DVD soon, I have bought all the other Rankin/Bass that has been released on DVD.The publishing rights to most of the Rankin/Bass catalog of films is currently owned by Little Golden Books, and they have begin the long and expesive process of preserving and restoring the original films, and releasing them on DVD. They have done a great job with the other films, some that look as good as they did when they were made. They even restored missing footage to Rudolph. Theyhave been adding extra features and behind the scenes featurettes to the DVD\\'s as well, and creating some very nice box sets.', 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'Thanksgiving Holiday fun from Rankin/Bass', 'unixReviewTime': 1058140800, 'reviewTime': '07 14, 2003'}\n",

This was made by Rankin & Bass in 1968,who were at the height of their creative genius in the 60's, most known for Classic Christmas tales like Frosty the Snowman, Rudolph, and Santa Claus is Coming to Town.  This story tells the story of the voyage of the Pilgrims to America, but told from the perspective of mice who also make the perilous journey.  It's narrated by Tennessee Ernie Ford as we learn of the harsh journey over the Atlantic before the Pilgrims make it safely to the new world and are greeted by Indians and start their new lives.  Besides Ford the voice cast also includes Eddie Albert of Green Acres fame as Captain Standish.Like Frosty, this is done in regular animation and in that regard it has a look very similar to other Rankin & Bass specials like `Twas the Night before Christmas and others of the same period.  I always thought Rankin & Bass were vastly underrated as an animation studio.  This was a Thanksgiving tradition for a number of years but I have not seen it pop up on TV for quite a long time.  Unfortunately it's not on DVD yet so tracking a copy down may be hard.  Hopefully this will arrive on DVD soon.Reviewed by Tim Janson\", 'overall': 5.0, 'summary': 'A THANKSGIVING TRADITION', 'unixReviewTime': 1141171200, 'reviewTime': '03 1, 2006'}\n",

However, you can count on Rankin/Bass, the long-reigning kings of enchanted holiday programming, to have left us this warm, entertaining show.Treading a fine line between historical accuracy and cartoon make-believe, Mouse On The Mayflower tells the tale of the Pilgrims' toilsome trip over to Plymouth Rock from the perspective of its tiniest passenger - a mouse! Although this special was done in traditional animation, and not the charming Animagic puppet-animation the studio is most well-known for, it still bears all of the trademarks of a Rankin/Bass special - with that bouncy background music that gets you all hyped up for the holiday. Also, like most other R/B specials, this one gets better and better each year you view it, with the songs becoming more familiar and enjoyable every time.With the lack of Thanksgiving Day Specials out there, and the beloved legend-like status of Rankin/Bass, you would think that this one would have been released on DVD a long time - but not the case! We are still left with a decade-old VHS release as our only source. Hopefully this will change soon.\", 'overall': 4.0, 'summary': 'Rankin/Bass Does Thanksgiving!!', 'unixReviewTime': 1322006400, 'reviewTime': '11 23, 2011'}\n",
